## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Asset Integrity Fix
**Problem**: Test was treating directories as files, causing false failures

**Solution**: Updated `verifyAssetIntegrity()` function in `test-mobile-app.js`
- Added proper directory/file detection using `stats.isDirectory()` and `stats.isFile()`
- Implemented recursive asset scanning for subdirectories
- Added total asset size calculation and reporting
- Changed validation logic from strict count matching to presence validation

```javascript
// Before: Only checked file size
if (stats.size > 0) {
  validAssets++;
}

// After: Proper directory/file handling
if (stats.isDirectory()) {
  // Handle subdirectories recursively
} else if (stats.isFile()) {
  // Handle individual files
}
```

### 2. Performance Check Fix
**Problem**: `getTotalBuildSize()` function returned NaN due to improper size accumulation

**Solution**: Refactored size calculation logic
- Fixed recursive directory size calculation
- Added proper return values from nested functions
- Included both `dist` and `apk-build` directories in total calculation
- Implemented proper error handling for missing directories

```javascript
// Before: Incorrect accumulation
totalSize += calculateSize(itemPath); // Modified global variable

// After: Proper return-based accumulation
dirSize += calculateSize(itemPath); // Local accumulation with return
return dirSize;
```
